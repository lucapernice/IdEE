### Welcome to IdEE!

**IdEE** is a blog created by three friends who wanted a place to share their interests **freely**. From Artificial Intelligence to Mathematics, Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, and more, we cover a wide range of topics.

We're still in the early stages, but we're excited to share our thoughts and insights with you. Stay tuned as we continue to grow and expand our content.

Thanks for stopping by, and we hope you enjoy what we have to offer!    

### Who We Are

We are passionate about learning and exploring the vast expanse of knowledge that the world has to offer. Our diverse backgrounds and interests allow us to bring unique perspectives to the table. Meet the team:

    <h3>Thomas</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Thomas, and I’m here for you. After graduating from the University of Trieste with a bachelor’s degree in Materials Engineering, I am currently a master's degree student in Materials Engineering and Nanotechnologies at Politecnico di Milano. My fields of expertise are materials science and engineering, solid state physics, and the study of nanostructures. In this blog, I will share my knowledge about what I study every day, trying to explain it as simply as possible. My goal is to explain the physical principles behind the phenomena we will look at without delving into complex mathematical derivations, focusing instead on their phenomenological descriptions and on what’s causing them.</p>
    <p>To fully understand what I’ll be discussing, some decent background in mathematics, physics, and chemistry is required. However, don’t worry—I’ll describe phenomena in the simplest way possible, so it won’t be hard to read my articles.</p>
